GitHub Hello World Tutorial
About Me - I am a father to seven (six + one in heaven) children.  I am comfortable defining myself as a father that strives to put my children in a position to succeed in the world.  In my day job I'm in a role bridging the gap between the customer support staff and the developers working on the systems.  I have interests in Unix (MacOS and Linux/BSD), web development, linux system administration, data science, APIs, and anything else!
